  <h2>Vision</h2>
  <p>
    A future of lucid human-AI symbiosis, where empirical self-knowledge allows 
    humanity to integrate with the digital interface without losing our agency 
    or ability to reason.
  </p>

  <h2>Mission</h2>
  <p>
    To serve as a trusted observatory for global human cognition in the era of 
    artificial intelligence—delivering open-source frameworks grounded in science, 
    instruments that reveal how we think in relation to machines, and a commons 
    where individual insight produces collective understanding.
  </p>

  <h2>Prior</h2>
  <p>
    For most of human history, <em>know thyself</em> remained an aspiration—inscribed 
    on temple walls, debated in philosophy, pursued through contemplation, but never 
    verifiable. The tools did not exist. Introspection could not observe itself. The 
    mind doing the examining was the same mind being examined, and the circularity 
    was inescapable.
  </p>
  <p>
    Humanity has not been idle in the face of this challenge. Contemplative traditions 
    developed rigorous practices for self-observation. Philosophers constructed 
    frameworks for understanding the mind. Healers and guides of every kind have 
    helped individuals navigate their inner lives. This work has value, and it continues.
  </p>
  <p>
    What has been missing is infrastructure—shared instruments grounded in cognitive 
    science, capable of generating structured observations at scale, and open to 
    scrutiny and refinement. The emergence of artificial intelligence has made such 
    infrastructure possible. And the emergence of machine cognition has given humanity, 
    for the first time, a point of comparison—a way for each individual to see their 
    own thinking through the lens of an intelligence that mirrors their own.
  </p>
  <p>
    The ancient imperative can now be pursued empirically—not as a replacement for 
    contemplative and therapeutic traditions, but as a complement to them. The question 
    is no longer whether self-knowledge is possible, but whether we will build the 
    infrastructure to make it accessible.
  </p>
  <p>Phronos emerged to build that infrastructure.</p>

  <h2>Axiom I: The Observatory</h2>
  <p>
    Phronos is an observatory—a place of structured observation of human cognition. 
    Our instruments generate telemetry: structured observations of cognition in action. 
    Our methods specify how those observations were made. Our dispatches communicate 
    what we find. The work renders visible what was previously inaccessible to examination.
  </p>

  <h2>Axiom II: The Question of This Era</h2>
  <p>
    The defining question of this era is not <em>who am I?</em> but <em>where am I still myself?</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    Our cognition is being actively reshaped by our information environment, but we 
    lack objective, practical measures to inform our fitness. Meanwhile, a new 
    intelligence has entered the world. It learns from us, speaks like us, and thinks 
    alongside us. The rate of adoption is without precedent, as is the nature of the 
    technology: for the first time in history, humanity is being equipped with 
    conversational companions trained on humanity's own behaviors, beliefs, language, 
    and practices. We do not yet fully understand what this means for the human mind 
    that encounters such an intelligence daily—that delegates to it, collaborates 
    with it, and, increasingly, builds a relationship with it.
  </p>

  <h2>Axiom III: The Work</h2>
  <p>The observatory produces four kinds of output:</p>
  <p>
    <strong>Dispatches.</strong> Essays that report what the observatory detects—patterns 
    in human-AI interaction, signals in the noise, findings that warrant attention.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Methods.</strong> Methodologies for measuring cognition, published openly. 
    These bridge empirical research with real-world application, specifying how 
    observations are made and scored.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Instruments.</strong> Tools that implement the methods. Dynamic assessments 
    that observe how you actually think, not merely what you report believing.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Data.</strong> A commons of anonymized observations, available to researchers 
    and the public. Individual participation advances collective understanding.
  </p>

  <h2>Axiom IV: The Self-Correcting Loop</h2>
  <p>
    Phronos operates as a cycle: knowledge flows into frameworks, frameworks shape 
    methods, methods are implemented as instruments, instruments generate data, 
    data produces findings, findings refine frameworks.
  </p>
  <p>
    We represent this as the ouroboros—the serpent consuming itself to perpetuate 
    itself. The loop is our operating principle.
  </p>
  <p>
    When our frameworks are wrong, the data will reveal it. Through openness, we 
    subject ourself to scrutiny, which keeps us honest in our perpetual pursuit.
  </p>

  <h2>Axiom V: Participants</h2>
  <p>Those who engage with Phronos instruments are participants, not users.</p>
  <p>
    A user consumes a product. A participant contributes to an endeavor. Every 
    completed instrument generates observations that—with consent—join the data 
    commons. By engaging, you contribute to a collective understanding of human 
    cognition larger than any individual.
  </p>
  <p>
    This framing carries obligation. We owe participants transparency about how 
    their data is used, clarity about what the instruments measure, and honesty 
    about the limitations of our methods.
  </p>

  <h2>Axiom VI: Sovereignty and the Commons</h2>
  <p>Your data belongs to you. Participation is voluntary. Consent is explicit.</p>
  <p>
    For those who choose to contribute, the data commons aggregates anonymized 
    observations into a resource for science and for the public. Individual 
    sovereignty and collective knowledge are not opposites. Your data remains 
    yours, yet through aggregation and anonymization, it advances understanding 
    that belongs to everyone.
  </p>
  <p>Data shared for one purpose will not be repurposed without permission. Participant data is never sold.</p>

  <h2>Axiom VII: Openness</h2>
  <p>We lead with openness because openness is the only path to trust.</p>
  <p>
    The methods are published. The instruments are documented. The data commons 
    serves anyone who can use it. If the methods are visible, they can be scrutinized. 
    If the data is shared, findings can be replicated. Scrutiny is how the work 
    earns trust. Openness is how the work makes lasting impact.
  </p>
  <p>
    Openness also serves survival. Open methods cannot be monopolized. If Phronos 
    fails, the work persists for others to continue.
  </p>

  <p>
    This constitution is a living document. As Phronos grows and learns, the 
    constitution will be revised—openly, with rationale documented.
