      - "Uncertainty-acknowledging"
      - "Connects data to meaning"
    example: "The individuals engaging in chats we label as 'toxic' may not be inherently toxic people. There are measurable features in their communication that point to a disordered pattern of thoughts—a disorder of cognition, rather than of morality."

    attributes:
      - "Technical precision"
      - "Assumptions stated explicitly"

    attributes:
      - "Clear instructions"

  # AESTHETIC PRINCIPLES
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  aesthetic:
    description: "Rigorous, cartographic, observatory-inspired"
    references:
      - "Scientific instrument interfaces"
      - "Cartographic maps and atlases"
      - "Historical observatory equipment"
      - "Academic journal layouts"
      - "Bloomberg terminal (data density)"
    
    principles:
      - "Hard edges over soft gradients"
      - "Offset shadows over blur shadows"
      - "Grid backgrounds evoke precision"
      - "Monospace for data, serif for narrative"
      - "Gold as the only accent color"
      - "Restrained animation (functional, not decorative)"
      - "Mobile Reduction: On small screens, collapse 'The Rail' into a bottom-sheet or a 'Signal Feed' tab. Do not stack it below the footer."
      - "Chart Responsiveness: On mobile, hide the 'Grid Major' background to reduce noise. Show only the 'Trace Line' and 'Current Value'."
    
  data_density:
    principle: "Evidence over Decoration."
    implementation:
      - "Hero sections should center on a specific Inquiry, Finding, or Question."
      - "Do not use 'Lorem Ipsum' numbers. Use real static data from published dispatches."
      - "If live sensors are offline, show the 'Last Known Trace' or 'Archived Observation'."
    visual_style:
      static_artifacts:
        style: "Sparklines and Distribution Bars"
        principle: "Treat data visualizations as illustrations/figures, not just UI elements."
        reference: "Tufte's Sparklines, Scientific Journal Figures"
    
    avoid:
      - "Startup-y gradients"
      - "Rounded corners (except status dots)"
      - "Gamification elements"
      - "Playful illustrations"
      - "Stock photography"
      - "Blur shadows"
      - "Multiple accent colors"
      - "Emoji or decorative icons"

# =============================================================================
# CONTENT PRINCIPLES
# How we create content
# =============================================================================

content:

  headlines:
    style: "Statement, not question"
    punctuation: "Period or none; never exclamation"
    examples:
      good:
        - "What 4.8 Million AI Conversations Reveal About Human Cognition"
        - "The instruments must be built"
        - "Measuring how you think"
      bad:
        - "Ready to discover your cognitive potential?"
        - "Unlock your brain's hidden power!"
        - "What kind of thinker are you?"

  body_copy:
    sentence_length: "Varied; prefer shorter"
    paragraph_length: "3-5 sentences maximum"
    jargon: "Define on first use; prefer plain language"
    citations: "Include in dispatches and methods; inline or footnote"

  calls_to_action:
    style: "Invitation, not command"
    examples:
      good:
        - "Read the dispatch"
        - "View the methodology"
        - "Begin assessment"
        - "Join the Guild"
      bad:
        - "Start your journey!"
        - "Unlock your potential now"
